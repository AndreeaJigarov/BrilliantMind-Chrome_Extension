# Welcome to your organization's demo respository

This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.

commit structure:

- feat: for new feature, no fixes
- fix: for fixes, quick refactorizations and so on
- data: for data base changes, scheme updates and over all repository work

  examples:

  feat: implemented the new widget for the front page
  fix: repaired the api endpoint for the product entity
  data: added price_tag to the product entity
